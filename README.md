Analysis of three datasets for count data analysis, survival analytics and missing value imputation .

This report consists of three topics mainly,

1.Count Data Regression- To think beyond linear regression ? Linear Regression not giving desired results? If you are stuck at this stage  Linear Regression might not be te apt choice in the case of handling count data.Possion Regression and Negative Binomial could be explored.

2.Survival Analytics - Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. Survival analysis attempts to answer questions such as: what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival? One such dataset with one such question is analyzed in this part.

3.Missing Data Imputation using MICE - this part of the report helps to compare and correct the problems caused by missing data with modelling.First we try to fit a linear model in a dataset with some missing values and then we impute the data and apply model into it.The results are astonishing.
